In this project the main priority was to see how the current pandemic affected people by observing the changes in an individuals socioeconomic
behavioral patterns.I did this through issuing a 2 part survey. The first part featured categorical questions, and the second ordinal. The answers
for the categorical are discrete, yes and no. Yes will be represented numerically as a 1, and No as a 0. As for my ordinal answer choices, they range
from 1 to 5. 1 will represent a strongly disagree, and and 5 will represent strongly agree. 3 will be the neutral ground.
The first set of questions revolved around whether the person was employed, their age, gender, and marital status. The second set 
of questions included if an individual started to consume more alcoholic and/or caffeinated beverages, purchased more entertainment 
subcriptions, and tracking changes in online shopping. For my analysis, I used box plots, scatter plots, and logistic regressions. 
In my scatter plot, I tracked the frequency by keeping count of the how many people had the same responses in their respective groups.
The reason for my choosing a logistic regression is because in my research, I found that this was the best type of regression to use
when dealing with ordinal data. As for the results, I invite you to visit the app, and check which groups you'd like to analyze. For 
example, when looking at the third tab, and clicking on scatter plot, you'll see that the default is that the y-axis is employed, and 
the x-axis is social media. The way to interpret is this is that regardless of your employment status, most people either agree, 4, or strongly
agreed, 5 when talk about their increase in social media usage during this pandemic.
